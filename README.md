I'm putting this under GPL license.  If you like my scripts, feel free to use them how you see fit.

That being said, most of these scripts I've written and commented on as much as I can.  Some were just awesome scripts that I found and shared here.  Where ever possible, I've made sure to give credit to the original author.  Sometimes I can't find the author, so I just put "blatantly stolen" if I remember to.

Basically, if you like the scripts, enjoy them, share them, maybe talk nicely about me at a company party while getting drunk at the open bar.  :)
